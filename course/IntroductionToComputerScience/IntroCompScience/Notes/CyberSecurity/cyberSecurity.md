## Passwords

## E-mails, private mode

In Gmail, there is a feature called 'Confidential mode', where the users are able to send emails and 'Recipents' won't have the option to forward, copy, print or download the email.

But it is a bit misleading, since the reciever can take a screenshot of the email, or even a photo of the computer's screen.

The browser, too, might provide an 'Incognito mode / private mode' where the browsing history and other pieces of data are't saved locally.

But the websites the user is visiting and the internett service provider might still see what has been visited.

## Encryption

**Encruption** is the scrambling of information so that it can't be read without a key to decrypt it.

The phrase `T H I S W A S C S 5 0`, for example might be simply encrypted to `U I J T X B T D T 5 0`, by rotating each letter once.

`https://` is a secure, encrypted way for browsers to communicate with web pages, without anyone in between able to read the contents.

**End-toend encryption** means that messages are encrypted between A and B, so even if a user using a third-party chat or video service, the companies in between are not able to decrypt, or read the contents of the communications.

Zoom f.eks. had previously advertised end-to-end encryption, but only implemented it as encryption between the participants in a meeting, but some features won't work as a result, like cloud recording and phone call-in.

## Summary

Suggestion to be more secure.

- Use Password safe
- Two factor authentication
- end-to-end encryption
