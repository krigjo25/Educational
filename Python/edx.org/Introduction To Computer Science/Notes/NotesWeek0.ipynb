    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "the patterns of bits `72, 73, 33` could be indicating ammount of red, green and blue in a color.<br>\n",
    "The program would know those bitrs map to color if we opened an image file, as opposed to receiving them in a text message.\n",
    "Each number might be 8 bits with 256 possibilities, or 24 bits, can be represented millions of colors.<br>\n",
    "The three bytes from above would represent a dark shade of yellow\n",
    "\n",
    "The square dots on the screens are called **pixels**, and images are made up of many thousands or millions of pixels. By using three bytes to represent the color for each pixel, a pixels can be seen in an emoji, if zoomed in.\n",

    "Videos are sequence of many images, changing multiple times a second to give us the appearance of motion, as a flipbook might do.<br>\n",
    "Music can also be represented with bits, MIDI is one such formatt which represents music with numbers for each of the notes and their duration and volumne.<br>\n",
    "So all of these ideas are just zeros and ones, interpreted and used by software which have been written to interpret them in the given ways.<br>\n",
    "There is other formats, some of which use compression (mathematical ways to represent some data with fewer bits), ooor some which might be containers that store multiple types of data together<br>\n",
    "Since there are many companies and groups developing software. There is lots of different file formats in existance, each with their own ways of representing data, but there also organizations that work on some consensus, like the one responsible for maintaining the Unicode standard."
