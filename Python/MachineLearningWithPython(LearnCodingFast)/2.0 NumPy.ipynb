    "\n",
    "* It's designed to work with arrays. Basic Python arrays has limited functionalities Which means you can not work with advanced mathematical operations with basic arrays.\n",

    "* NumPy can perform various complex operations on arrays including shape manipulation, basic linear algebra, random simulation and more.\n",
